# Mikke

Simple scoring app for the darts game "Mickey Mouse". This is still WIP, a few improvements that I want to make can be found in the todo list below. PRs are more than welcome ❤️

To access the settings screen, scroll to the right.

### Todo

- [x] Add players to the line-up
- [x] Remove players from the line-up
- [ ] Design logo and set it as favicon and touch icons
- [ ] Snap to the offset settings screen instead of normal scroll behavior
- [ ] List all the players vertically in the settings screen
- [x] Make it possible to re-order the players by dragging the name area
- [ ] Style the settings page
- [ ] Give a random color to players
- [ ] When game is finished, prompt about starting a new game,
      if a new game is wanted, rank the players and re-set the
      line-up so the lower ranked player starts.
